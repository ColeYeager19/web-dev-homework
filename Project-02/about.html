<h1>Why Choose to Teach Cooking?</h1>
<p>My mother is the best chef I've ever known and to this day remains entirely self taught.
   As I grew up she taught me everything she knew about cooking and baking so that I would both
   be able to assist her, but also so I'd know the family recipes by heart. Looking back
   my favorite memories are of her teaching me to cook, so I decided I should pass some
   of that experience along. Since salmon is her favorite dish I found a couple recipes from
   the video and website that I thought may be worth sharing. My hope is that the
   ease of these recipes incourages others to learn so they can share the same appreciation
   of cooking that I now hold.</p>
