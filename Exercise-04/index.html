    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>Just as I thought it was going alright</P>
<p>I find out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right</P>
<p>S'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all</P>
<p>I could say day, and you'd say night</P>
<p>Tell me it's black when I know that it's white</P>
<p>Always the same, it's just a shame, that's all</P>
<p>I could leave but I won't go</P>
<p>Though my heart might tell me so</P>
<p>I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes</P>
<p>But why does it always seem to be</P>
<p>Me looking at you, you looking at me</P>
<p>It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all</P>
<p>Turning me on, turning me off,</P>
<p>Making me feel like I want too much</P>
<p>Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time</P>
<p>Running around, staying out all night</P>
<p>Taking it all instead of taking one bite</P>
<p>Living with you's just putting me through it all of the time</P>
<p>I could leave but I won't go</P>
<p>Well it'd be easier I know</P>
<p>I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes</P>
<p>Why does it always seem to be</P>
<p>Me looking at you, you looking at me</P>
<p>It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all</P>
<p>Truth is I love you</P>
<p>More than I wanted to</P>
<p>There's no point in trying to pretend</P>
<p>There's been no-one who</P>
<p>Makes me feel like you do</P>
<p>Say we'll be together 'till the end</P>
<p>I could leave but I won't go</P>
<p>It'd be easier I know</P>
<p>I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes</P>
<p>So why does it always seem to be</P>
<p>Me looking at you, you looking at me</P>
<p>It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all</P>
<p>But I love you</P>
<p>More than I wanted to</P>
<p>There's no point in trying to pretend</P>
<p>There's been no-one who</P>
<p>Makes me feel like you do</P>
<p>Say we'll be together 'till the end</P>
<p>But just as I thought it was going alright</P>
<p>I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right</P>
<p>It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all</P>
<p>Well I could say day, and you'd say night</P>
<p>Tell me it's black when I know that it's white</P>
<p>It's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all</P>
<p>That's all</p>
