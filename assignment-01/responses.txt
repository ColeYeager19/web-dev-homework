I have plans to start an online business and wanted to further my knowledge of web development to build the business entirely myself. 

I am hoping to increase my knowledge of CSS and how it works; this has been the main struggle in my time coding. 

This image is where my plans took off; the president of my previous college asked for a print of it to hang in his office. It was that day I realized I could make a legitimate business selling my artwork. So, I often look back upon this image whenever I doubt myself as a reminder that I am capable.
